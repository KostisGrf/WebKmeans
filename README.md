Web K-means is a web application that can help you specify the k value of k-means clustering by utilizing the elbow method

The k-means algorithm is a data clustering algorithm. The main drawback is that the user must specify the number (k) of the clusters that the algorithm will "discover". However, the user may not advance the specific number, and if the algorithm is run with a different value of k, completely different clusters will be discovered. One way to specify the parameter value is the Elbow method. The goal of the thesis is the development of a web application where each user will be able to upload data sets and the application will construct the graph where the "elbow" will be presented and will suggest to the user a possible value for the parameter k.

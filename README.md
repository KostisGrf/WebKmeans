**Web K-Means** is a web application that helps users determine the optimal number of clusters (*k*) for the k-means clustering algorithm by utilizing the **Elbow Method**.

The **k-means** algorithm groups data into *k* clusters, but its main drawback is that the user must define *k* in advance. Choosing different values for *k* can produce completely different clustering results. The **Elbow Method** assists by plotting the distortion for different *k* values and identifying the point where increasing *k* no longer significantly improves performance.

ðŸ”¬ **Publications & Evolution**:
- The project was **presented and published** at **NiDS 2023 (Conference on Informatics & Data Science)**.
- Following the conference, the web app evolved into **K-Cluster Hub**, extending support to additional clustering algorithms such as **K-Modes** and **K-Prototypes**, enabling analysis of categorical and mixed-type data.
- The extended version was **published in MDPI.**
